# üìà EV Vehicle Demand Prediction

This project uses machine learning to forecast the adoption and demand of electric vehicles (EVs) based on county-level data. Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, this project helps understand patterns in EV adoption using real-world datasets.

---

## üîç Overview

Electric Vehicles are rapidly gaining popularity due to environmental concerns and government incentives. This project explores EV registration data and uses predictive modeling to estimate future demand for EVs in different regions.
